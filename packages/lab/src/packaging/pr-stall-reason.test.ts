// no-token: #2968 -- nothing here runs `gh`; every pull request is a literal object handed to the pure classifier.
/**
 * #2968: A PULL REQUEST THAT CANNOT MERGE FOR ANY REASON BUT RED HAS AN OWNER SIGNAL.
 *
 * #2950 sat a DRAFT, `DIRTY`, with an EMPTY `statusCheckRollup` for 7.5 hours and no order reached its owner: the
 * conflict order was fed by "not a draft, settled GREEN", and a branch that conflicts gets no `pull_request` run.
 * The class is a state no population could see, so the population here is the CROSS PRODUCT of the domain, not a list
 * of the cases somebody thought of -- the case nobody thought of is what #2950 was.
 *
 * THE EMPTINESS CONTROL: `CELLS.length` is asserted equal to the product of the dimensions' sizes, and every one of
 * the seven reasons is asserted to OCCUR in the population, so "every cell returns one reason" cannot pass on an
 * empty or a one-answer classifier.
