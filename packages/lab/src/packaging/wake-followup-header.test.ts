/**
 * #2538: THE FIRST-CONTACT PREAMBLE GOES ON A SESSION'S FIRST ORDER ONLY (chairman, relayed by `ceo`, 2026-09-25).
 * `worker-2443`'s second order arrived wrapped in the WHOLE preamble again -- "Before you start", "Work autonomously",
 * "ENDING YOUR TURN", ~1,640 chars -- into a context that already held it. Since #2483 a per-row instance is never
 * cleared, so every copy stays.
 *
 * DRIVEN THROUGH `deliver` AND `clearThenPrompt`, the two paths that type an order, because a phrase grep over
 * `addressed` alone would pass with `deliver` never asking for the header. THE FIVE FORMS are each one test below, and
 * the positive control (a cleared standing seat DOES get the preamble) sits in the same file: a header given to
 * everybody would pass the follow-up half by removing the preamble altogether.
