 * named three writers in until this row.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-12: eleven scripts spawn `gh` with a body flag; #1052 guarded three of them and eight
 * sent a body nothing had checked. None demonstrably carried a leak — every one composes its body from
 * computed values — so this is not a live hole. **It is filed because the class was stated as closed and
 * was not, and the statement is what the next person reads.**
 *
 * The guard is REACHABILITY, not text: a writer is guarded when its local-import closure reaches this
 * module, because five spawn helpers serve these eleven writers and guarding a helper covers its consumers
 * and every call added to them tomorrow. A `grep` for the function name would report four correctly
 * guarded writers as unguarded — the same defect as counting writers by the shape of their `gh` call.
 * BARE NAMES, NOT PATHS, and that is not cosmetic. `spawned-paths.test.ts` refuses a repo-relative program
 * path in source, because a program spawned by one breaks when the cwd moves -- a real defect, whose check
 * is "a string that looks like a path to a script". **This list is eleven such strings that are never
 * spawned**, so it fired eleven times on a declaration. The remedy it names (resolve from
 * `import.meta.url`) would turn a readable list into eleven absolute paths for no gain, so the string the
 * guard matches is removed instead of argued with: the walk prefixes `TRACKER_WRITER_DIR`.

 * invocation is right to be shallow and wrong to be obeyed literally. (worker-judge, on #1066.)
