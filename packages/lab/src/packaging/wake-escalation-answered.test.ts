/**
 * #2462: REMOVING `needs:chairman` IS AN ANSWER, and the gate must not undo it. Measured 2026-09-25: #2451, #2258 and
 * #2223 were re-labelled 26-28 s after a person removed the label, because the state after the removal (key at the cap,
 * cause still emitted) is the state before it, and `escalateStuck` read nothing that said it had already escalated.
 *
 * Its own file for #2280's reason (`wake.test.ts` reaches `gh`, so the token-less acceptance job refuses it). The
 * entry is driven through PATH stubs with a real ledger file, because a test that handed `escalateStuck` its memory
 * would pass with the writer deleted: what the tick WRITES is what the next tick READS.
 *
 * Every refusal has the same fixture with ONE thing changed as its control, so the test names what flipped the outcome.
