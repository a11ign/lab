 * #2407: ONE INSTANCE, ONE ROW -- `row-claim`'s half (`ceo`, on the chairman's direction of 2026-09-24). The router's
 * half is `wake-one-row.test.ts`; "the offer alone is not the drain, the claim is the other half" (#2324) holds here
 * for the same reason: an instance told to claim the next Ready row by hand goes around any router.
 *
 * The fact arrives as `instance` -- what the instance holds or has held -- so `oneRowReason` and `claimRow` are called
 * with the roster they mean and read no host. The CLI reads it (`instanceNow`), which is what the last two tests drive as
 * a PROCESS: an injected seam is exactly what a deleted call goes around.
