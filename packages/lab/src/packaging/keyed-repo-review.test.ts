/**
 * #2969: A REPOSITORY THE ORG OPENS PULL REQUESTS IN, THAT THE GATE DOES NOT DECLARE, IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY PULL-REQUEST CAUSE.
 *
 * 2026-10-02: `a11ign/agent-org#6` had green checks, no review request and no review for hours, and `#3` for a day, because
 * `.agent-org/project.json` declared one code repository and nothing ticks, reviews or watches the others. Four things were missing, and
 * each is pinned below by a test that goes red when it is taken away:
 *
 *   (1) the DECLARATION  `agent-org` is a code scope, and every repository the organisation has is a declared scope or a named exemption
 *   (2) the CHECKOUT     `noReviewCheckoutFor` is `null` for a declared key whose clone the host names, and the fetch is made FROM that clone
 *   (3) the DOOR         the keyed reviewer's order and environment carry `GH_REPO=<repo>`
 *   (4) the OWNER        a keyed pull request nobody owns falls to `ownerOfPr`'s last rung, `ceo`, never to nobody
 *
 * AND THE PRIMARY IS UNTOUCHED (3 of the row's list): the empty key's seat, ref, fetch root and prompt are asserted byte for byte.
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROLS ARE IN THIS FILE, each next to the assertion it serves (`.claude/rules/guards-and-assertions.md`).
