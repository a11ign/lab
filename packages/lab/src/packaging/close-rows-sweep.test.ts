/**
 * #394: A BACKSTOP FOR THE CLOSE-ROWS PATH (close-rows.yml until #909, now trunk.yml's closeRows job), WHICH FIRED FOR SOME MERGES AND NOT OTHERS FOR AN UNEXPLAINED
 * REASON. `mergedPrsInWindow` is driven with an injected `gh` so the query shape is proven without a live
 * repo; `main()`'s CLI behaviour (unknown flags, missing GITHUB_REPOSITORY) is driven for real, the same
 * way `queue-stalled.test.ts` and `auto-arm-sweep.mjs`'s siblings are. `closurePlan` itself (imported from
 * close-rows-for-merged-pr.mjs, never re-derived) already has its own tests -- this file does not repeat
 * them, only proves the sweep wires to the real thing rather than a copy.
