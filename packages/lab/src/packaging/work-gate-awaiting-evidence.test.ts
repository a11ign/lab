/**
 * #2416: THE `awaiting-evidence` PR LABEL -- no verdict order, no author prompt and a stale-wait order.
 *
 * ITS OWN FILE, and not a block in `work-gate.test.ts`, for #2324's reason: that file reaches `gh`, so the
 * token-less acceptance job refuses it and would verify nothing. Every read here is handed a seam.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE PINNED. A `decide` that returned `[]` for a labelled draft satisfies every "no order"
 * assertion below, so each is beside its positive control: the SAME draft without the label still wakes its
 * reviewer, a red labelled one still wakes its author, a labelled one with a hand-posted verdict still has
 * that verdict read, and a labelled one quiet for 48h still reaches `product-manager`.
