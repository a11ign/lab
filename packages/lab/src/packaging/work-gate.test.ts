/**
 * #912: THE TICK IS A SCRIPT, AND THESE ARE THE ANSWERS IT MUST NOT GET WRONG.
 *
 * Six sessions each held a standing cron and woke every 10-30 minutes to ask a question one API call
 * answers -- 672 model turns a day, most finding nothing, which exhausted a weekly allowance in three
 * days. `work-gate.mjs` is that question, asked for free. So the failures that matter here are the ones
 * that would either put the org back to sleep or wake all of it:
 *
 * A REFUSED READ MUST NEVER READ AS QUIET. Both readers return `null` for a refusal and never `[]`
 * (#1286's rule, and its reason: a refused `gh` exits non-zero with EMPTY stdout, so `[]` reports "nothing
 * is queued" and the org acts on it). The positive control is that an empty queue still returns `[]` and
 * still means quiet -- a reader answering `refused` whenever unsure blocks every quiet morning.
 *
 * AND THE POSITIVES ARE NOT OPTIONAL, for `review-verdict.test.ts`'s reason one level up: a `decide` that
 * returned `[]` for everything satisfies every "no order" case perfectly and would wake nobody, ever.
