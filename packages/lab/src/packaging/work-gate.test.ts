 * Six sessions each held a standing cron and woke every 10-30 minutes to ask a question one API call
 * answers -- 672 model turns a day, most finding nothing, which exhausted a weekly allowance in three
 * days. `work-gate.mjs` is that question, asked for free. So the failures that matter here are the ones
 * that would either put the org back to sleep or wake all of it:
 *
 * A REFUSED READ MUST NEVER READ AS QUIET. Both readers return `null` for a refusal and never `[]`
 * (#1286's rule, and its reason: a refused `gh` exits non-zero with EMPTY stdout, so `[]` reports "nothing
 * is queued" and the org acts on it). The positive control is that an empty queue still returns `[]` and
 * still means quiet -- a reader answering `refused` whenever unsure blocks every quiet morning.
 *
 * AND THE POSITIVES ARE NOT OPTIONAL, for `review-verdict.test.ts`'s reason one level up: a `decide` that
 * returned `[]` for everything satisfies every "no order" case perfectly and would wake nobody, ever.

 *
 * #2331 REMOVED THE CAUSE, NOT THE REPORT. The gate now reads `branches/main`, which a non-admin
 * credential can read, so the admin-only 404 that produced the four dead days is gone -- and with it the
 * `branches/main.protected` DISCRIMINATOR that existed to explain that 404 (#2022's FORBIDDEN-versus-ABSENT).
 * Nothing reaches a second read any more: the discriminator was the same endpoint as the read it explained.
 * The report itself stays, because `branches/main` can still be refused (network, a renamed trunk) and
 * "fails open" must still announce itself.
 *

 * re-asked was DELIBERATE. That instruction was followed exactly: #1520 -- a measurement waiting for a
 * rehearsal-run count to reach 20, which is neither a row, a date nor a person -- was correctly
 * re-answered FOUR TIMES IN NINE HOURS (23:43, 01:44, 05:45, 08:21), each a full `sonnet`/`high` turn
 * reaching the identical conclusion, because nothing could record that the question had been answered.
 *
 * `product-manager` did nothing wrong at any point; the prompt ratified the loop. An explanation with
 * no horizon is not a terminal state.
 *
 * THE HORIZON IS ALSO THE ANSWER TO ROT, which is why it is a `Not-before:` and not a silence flag: an
 * unexaminable wait is exactly the kind that quietly becomes true, so it should go quiet for a while
 * and then be asked ONCE more -- never forever, never every two hours.

 *
 * #1799's fix re-keyed per row so a standing judgment stopped being re-litigated when an unrelated row
 * moved. That was right. THE IMPLEMENTATION SERIALISED THE QUEUE: one order per row, one delivered per
 * tick, the rest deduped for two hours each.

 * move for TWELVE HOURS -- while #1663, #1042, #914 and #1830 sat with nothing stopping them and ten

 * 2026-09-22 on #2000: `agent/worktree-prune-unit-2000` was pushed at 21:02:36Z; the row read `ready`,
 * no `session:`, no `in-progress`, until 21:22Z; `gh pr list --head <branch> --state all` returned `[]`
 * for that whole window. The gate offered #2000 as `ready-row-unclaimed` throughout, because `ready`
 * with no `session:` label was the ENTIRE question it asked, and a second session was routed into the
 * same three Region paths at 21:06Z.
 *
 * THE CAUSE OF THE STALENESS IS WHY THE DETECTION MUST NOT SPEND THE POOL. Opening the pull request is
 * the act that makes a row look claimed, and that act spends GraphQL: #1996's PR was never opened
 * because the shared 5,000-point pool was exhausted until 21:20:11Z. So the board goes stale precisely
 * when the pool is gone, and a detector that spent the pool would be blind in the same outage that
 * produces the defect. `git ls-remote --heads origin` spends none, and the test below pins the BINARY

 * it puts a `history` capability requirement into `work-gate.mjs` -- which `row-claim/runner-rule.mjs`
 * reaches, and most of the packaging suite imports THAT. Measured both ways: **4 test files derive a
 * `history` requirement, and 28 do with the import.** So the gate spawns instead, and these two
