/**
 * #912: THE TICK IS A SCRIPT, AND THESE ARE THE ANSWERS IT MUST NOT GET WRONG.
 *
 * Six sessions each held a standing cron and woke every 10-30 minutes to ask a question one API call
 * answers -- 672 model turns a day, most finding nothing, which exhausted a weekly allowance in three
 * days. `work-gate.mjs` is that question, asked for free. So the failures that matter here are the ones
 * that would either put the org back to sleep or wake all of it:
 *
 * A REFUSED READ MUST NEVER READ AS QUIET. Both readers return `null` for a refusal and never `[]`
 * (#1286's rule, and its reason: a refused `gh` exits non-zero with EMPTY stdout, so `[]` reports "nothing
 * is queued" and the org acts on it). The positive control is that an empty queue still returns `[]` and
 * still means quiet -- a reader answering `refused` whenever unsure blocks every quiet morning.
 *
 * AND THE POSITIVES ARE NOT OPTIONAL, for `review-verdict.test.ts`'s reason one level up: a `decide` that
 * returned `[]` for everything satisfies every "no order" case perfectly and would wake nobody, ever.

 *           depends on -- which account the daily board dispatch spends -- was still open.
 *   next    the tick PROMOTES #2002 from `backlog` to `ready` while it carries `answer:ceo`,
 *   tick    then emits `WOKE worker-capture <- engineers/ready-row-unclaimed/2002`.
 *
 * `worker-capture` was one turn from claiming a row whose whole point was that it must not run yet --
 * and running it would have made an unruled decision real on the host.
 *
 * THE GATE ALREADY READ THE LABEL. `GH_READS` names `issue list (all open: answer/blocked labels)` and
 * `answerOrders` was independently waking `ceo` about the same row on the same tick. What no path asked
 * was whether the label STOPS anything -- so `waiting on ceo` and `offer this to anyone` were both true.
