/**
 * #429, ON THE TRACKED RECORD -- the one assertion about the appendix's verdict slot that no fixture can make.
 *
 * `board-appendix-gate-kind.test.ts` tests `latestVerdictGate` directly, so a revert at `reported()`'s CALL
 * SITE -- the slot back to "newest entry of any kind" -- leaves every one of its tests green. This reads the
 * slot `reported()` actually fills from `docs/board/reported/`, and it is the test that catches that revert.
 * In its own file because it imports `board-data.mjs`, which spawns `gh`, and CI's acceptance job refuses
 * anything that does; it runs in the ordinary `ts` suite.
