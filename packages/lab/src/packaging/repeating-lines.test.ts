 * `packages/agent-org/src/repeating-lines.mjs` and its wiring in `work-gate.mjs`, #2848: A LOG LINE THAT REPEATS ABOUT A FAULT IS A DEFECT,
 * AND THE GATE NOW COUNTS THEM.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS THE TWO LINES THE ROW WAS FILED ABOUT -- `NOT RELEASED decline of N ...` and `UNDELIVERED claim release not done --
 * decline of N ...`, 944 and 935 times in 24 hours of the real journal. Every "is NOT offered" below (K-1 ticks, an allowlisted line, a line that
 * stopped) is only worth anything because those two ARE offered, through the same entry, in the same file.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLD IS WRITTEN OUT AS 30 AND 29 HERE, NEVER AS `REPEAT_TICKS` AND `REPEAT_TICKS - 1`: a test built from the constant moves with it, so
 * raising K by one would leave it green. The literal is what makes the row's mutation (K + 1, K - 1) go red.
