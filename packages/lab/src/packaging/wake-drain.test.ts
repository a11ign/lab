// THE WIRING, AS A PROCESS. `claimRow` takes `drained` from its caller, and the caller that matters is the CLI: an
// injected seam is exactly what a deleted call goes around, so this drives `row-claim.mjs claim` itself with a `gh`
// on PATH and a HOME with no ledger (an empty one keeps the drain in force). CI's plain clone is refused by the
// launch gate, so the printed override is set -- its first users are exactly these tests.
//
// IN A COPY OF ITS OWN CLOSURE, NOT THE CHECKOUT (#2394's first red): the CLI refuses first of all when it CANNOT
// ASK whether its rule is current (`origin/main` unresolvable) and when the rule IS behind, and the acceptance job's
// clone has no `origin/main` at the moment it runs the test, so the real checkout answered `COULD NOT DETERMINE`
// there. It would have gone red locally the day `main` moved a rule file, too. The copy is of the WORKING TREE
// (so a mutation made there is the one under test), is its own one-commit repo, and its `origin/main` is that
// commit -- a truthful "up to date", made in a directory nothing else reads.
