// no-token: gh -- pure: `decide` and `withPrOwners` over in-memory rows and pull requests; the stamp reader is handed a stubbed `git` and a stubbed stamp file, so nothing here reaches `gh`, `git` or the network
/**
 * #2941: A RED PULL REQUEST HAS AN OWNER BY A TOTAL FUNCTION. #2912 routed an unlabelled red PR to the session its closed row
 * names and left every PR with NO row going to `product-manager`, who does not fix code. The class is "a red PR whose owner the
 * gate cannot name", so this DERIVES the population -- every shape of PR from a generated grid -- and asserts the answer
 * for each cell rather than for the three the author thought of.
 *
 * THE ORDER (`ownerOfPr`): label, the live session holding the row it closes, the live session holding the row its branch suffix
 * names, a live session the head ref names, a live session that stamped its worktree, else `ceo`. The ORACLE below is written
 * out here, from that sentence, and not derived from the implementation -- a grid compared with the code it tests agrees by
 * construction.
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROLS: the first two tests are #2921's shape (a labelled draft) and a PR with no label, no row and an `agent/` branch,
 * each landing on the session the order says; the all-empty cell lands on `ceo`. The grid asserts its own CELL COUNT, so a grid
 * that shrinks to nothing is red rather than green (`.claude/rules/guards-and-assertions.md`).
