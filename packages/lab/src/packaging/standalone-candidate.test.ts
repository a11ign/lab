/**
 * #2873 (child 5d-2 of #69): THE TOOL TAKES ITS PROJECT FROM `host.json`, NOT FROM THREE DIRECTORIES ABOVE ITSELF.
 *
 * `HOME_CHECKOUT` was `packages/agent-org/src` up three, which holds only while the tool runs inside the product checkout. In the
 * standalone repository `src/` is at the root, up three is the home directory, and importing `project-vocabulary.mjs` died with
 * `ProjectDeclarationRefusal: .../.agent-org/project.json ... ENOENT` (#2846's real run). With `$AGENT_ORG_HOST` set it is now the
 * `checkout` of the host file's `primary` project (ADR 0040, decision 3).
 *
 * Every reading is a CHILD `node` process importing a COPY of `src` laid out as the standalone repository (`<scratch>/tool/src`),
 * because the module resolves `HOME_CHECKOUT` at import and a second import in this process would be the cache's answer:
 *   1. a host file whose primary holds a fixture `project.json` gives THE FIXTURE's labels and none of a11ign's;
 *   2. a host path that does not exist, a file that is not JSON, and a primary naming no project each REFUSE naming the path;
 *   3. `$AGENT_ORG_HOST` unset, in the product tree, still gives a11ign's own labels (nothing moved for the live units).
 * Positive controls: the SAME scratch tree with the variable unset fails with the `ENOENT` refusal (the failure is reachable, not
 * described), and a host file whose primary IS a11ign's checkout gives a11ign's labels from that tree (the green path is not a
 * fixture agreeing with itself).
