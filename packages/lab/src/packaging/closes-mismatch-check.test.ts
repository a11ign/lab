// no-token: lookupClosingIssues
// #827. Every fact this file feeds a decider is INJECTED, and the three CLI tests run the script against a fake
// `gh` first on PATH that answers from files, so nothing here reaches GitHub. The closure walk still finds
// `lookups.mjs`'s `gh` through `closes-mismatch-check.mjs`'s import; reaching it live is not what is tested.
/**
 * #549: a PR body can declare `Closes: none` and still close two issues, and nothing compared what the
 * author DECLARED against what GitHub RESOLVED. Measured live, same day: #545 declared `none` and closed
 * #492 and #494 anyway; #537 declared `none` and closed #494. Both cost a hand-reopen -- #492 twice.
 *
 * These fixtures are the ones the issue itself names, driving `closesMismatchReport` directly with an
 * INJECTED `resolved` array rather than a live `closingIssuesReferences` query -- the same "inject the
 * fact, never fetch it" shape every other `merge-guard/*-rule.test.ts` file already uses.
