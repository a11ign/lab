/**
 * `packages/agent-org/src/wait-condition.mjs` and its wiring, #2996: A DECLARED WAIT NAMES THE CONDITION IT WAITS FOR, AND THE TICK RE-READS IT.
 *
 * THE INCIDENT, REPLAYED (the chairman, 2026-10-02): the freeze ended at 06:50Z and four hours later `hold:ceo` was still on #2988/#2990 while twelve sessions
 * sat idle, because `holdersOf` and `NOT_STARTABLE` read a declared wait as proof of health. The positive control is that PR: `hold:ceo`, `Waiting-for: closed #2867`,
 * #2867 CLOSED. Every "is excused" below is only worth anything because that one is NOT.
 *
 * THE LITERALS ARE WRITTEN OUT, 4 HOURS AND 30 MINUTES, and `the constants are the row's` pins them to the exports in ONE place: a test built from the constant
 * moves with it, so moving N by one would leave it green.
 *
 * MUTATION, run by hand 2026-10-02 and recorded on the row, each restored byte-identical (`diff` of a copy): `conditionHolds` ALWAYS FALSE turns 10 of 30 red -- the positive
 * control, the exemption's trip, the end-to-end tick, the truth table and the per-kind cases that need a true condition -- and `the SAME fixture ... OPEN` stays green; ALWAYS TRUE turns
 * 10 red, the "unresolved is excused" ones among them. Each direction breaks the tests that assert its own half and no wiring test that does not read a condition.
