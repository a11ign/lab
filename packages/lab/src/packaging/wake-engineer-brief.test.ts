/**
 * #2406: A SPAWNED ENGINEER IS TOLD TO READ THE ENGINEER BRIEF, AND THE BRIEF HOLDS THE RESOURCE BAN.
 *
 * `sessions.json`'s `brief` field was read by no code, and `addressed()` -- which writes every session's first
 * message -- named no file under `docs/roles`, so a spawned engineer, which starts knowing nothing, was never told
 * the acceptance standard or the ban. Its own file, and not a block in `wake.test.ts`, for #2280's reason: that
 * file reaches `gh`, so the token-less acceptance job refused it and verified nothing.
 *
 * THE RETIREMENT ROW OWNS THIS FILE'S SECOND HALF. `worker-capture.md` and `worker-judge.md` are the SOURCE the ban
 * test derives from, and they are deleted by the retirement row, not by #2406; that row moves the derivation to
 * whatever then holds the ban and says so, rather than leaving this test to crash on a missing file.
