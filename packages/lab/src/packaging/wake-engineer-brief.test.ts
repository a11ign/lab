/**
 * #2406: A SPAWNED ENGINEER IS TOLD TO READ THE ENGINEER BRIEF, AND THE BRIEF HOLDS THE RESOURCE BAN.
 *
 * `sessions.json`'s `brief` field was read by no code, and `addressed()` -- which writes every session's first
 * message -- named no file under `docs/roles`, so a spawned engineer, which starts knowing nothing, was never told
 * the acceptance standard or the ban. Its own file, and not a block in `wake.test.ts`, for #2280's reason: that
 * file reaches `gh`, so the token-less acceptance job refused it and verified nothing.
 *
 * #2505 (the retirement row) DELETED `worker-capture.md` and `worker-judge.md`, which were the SOURCE the ban test derived
 * from. The derivation now reads the one place that holds the ban, `engineer.md`, and is checked against the eight
 * families the row measured, so it is no longer the brief compared with itself.
