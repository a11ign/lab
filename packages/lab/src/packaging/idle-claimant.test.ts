/**
 * #2999: AN IDLE CLAIMANT THAT DECLARED NO WAIT IS A STALL, AND ITS WAIT IS A FIELD OR IT IS NAMED ONE.
 *
 * Twelve sessions sat idle for hours and each named its wait in a terminal nobody reads. THE CONTROL FOR EVERY "NOT A STALL" ASSERTION IS THE SAME
 * FIXTURE WITH THE ONE FIELD REMOVED: a holder with a reviewer requested is not a stall only because the same holder with none IS one, and each
 * wait kind clears it only because the identical input without that kind stalls. Nothing here is asserted against an empty population.
