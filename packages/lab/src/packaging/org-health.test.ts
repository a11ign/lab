 * `packages/agent-org/src/org-health.mjs` and its wiring in `work-gate.mjs`, #2936: THE GATE ASKS HOW THE ORG IS DOING, AND WAKES `ceo` WITH THE EVIDENCE
 * WHEN NOTHING LANDS OR A RED PR AGES.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLDS ARE WRITTEN OUT AS 3 HOURS, 120 MINUTES, 75 TICKS AND 60 MINUTES HERE, NEVER AS THE EXPORTED CONSTANTS: a test built from the constant moves
 * with it, so raising N by one would leave it green. The literal is what makes the row's mutation (N + 1) go red, and `the constants are the table's` pins the
 * literals to the exports in ONE place, so the numbers cannot drift from the table posted on the row.
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROL, REPLAYED FROM THE RECORD: the merges around the 2026-10-01 idle window (#2839 at 2026-09-30T19:02:50Z, then nothing for 12.4 hours until #2844 at
 * 07:25:01Z -- both times measured from `gh pr list --state merged`) with one green PR waiting, and a red PR NO SESSION CAN BE NAMED FOR (the #2880 shape, #2941) that
 * its own account has commented on. Both are OFFERED, through the same entry every "is NOT offered" below goes through. Every clear and every unknown is only worth
 * anything because these two trip.
