/**
 * `packages/agent-org/src/prune-worktrees.mjs` removes a stale worktree only when it is BOTH merged into `origin/main`
 * and has a clean working tree, names everything else as DIRTY without touching it, and never touches the
 * PRIMARY checkout. See that file's own header for the incident (36 worktrees, 4.4 GB, a rule maintained
 * by hand).
 *
 * DRIVEN AGAINST REAL GIT FIXTURES, never against the live worktree tree, per the acceptance criteria's
 * own explicit requirement -- a prune that removes a dirty worktree is unrecoverable, so this proves the
 * logic against disposable repositories built and destroyed entirely under `/tmp`, structurally unable to
 * reach the real checkout this test itself runs from.
 *
 * GIT_* SCRUBBED on every spawn, including this file's own fixture-building `git()` helper: if `GIT_DIR`
 * happened to be set (this hook exports it into a hook environment, which is exactly why
 * `packages/guards/src/git-env.mjs` exists), an unscrubbed git call in a fixture helper would redirect onto whatever
 * `GIT_DIR` names instead of the intended disposable `/tmp` repo -- the identical class of defect closed
 * elsewhere today, caught here by `git-spawn-classification.test.ts`'s own discovery before this file
 * ever shipped.
