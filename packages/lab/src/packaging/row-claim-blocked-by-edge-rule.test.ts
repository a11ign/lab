/**
 * RULE: DOES THE ROW BEING CLAIMED CARRY ITS OWN OPEN `blockedBy` EDGE? -- #1886. See
 * `packages/agent-org/src/row-claim/blocked-by-edge-rule.mjs` for the full account: `row-claim.mjs` never
 * imported `waiting-condition.mjs` at all, so a row the gate correctly shelves (an open `blockedBy` edge)
 * could still be claimed directly by anyone who found it by label instead of through the gate -- #1852
 * carried an open `blockedBy` on #1878/#1883 while mislabelled `ready`, and neither B2 nor B4 has anything
 * to say about it.
