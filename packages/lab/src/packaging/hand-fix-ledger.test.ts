 * #2939 (chairman, 2026-10-01): a hand fix by the chairman's session is an org defect, and the count has a home.
 * The ledger counts changes by TWO mechanisms (the author field, and a declared `Hand-fix:` line), once each, and
 * says UNKNOWN when it could not read -- never zero.
 *
 * THE BASELINE FIXTURE IS REAL, not invented: the PR numbers, authors and merge times are what
 * `gh pr list --state merged --json number,author,title,mergedAt` returned on 2026-10-01, four of the chairman's
 * account's PRs (the last four it authored, all 2026-09-24) and four of the workers' account's (#2927-#2934, the
 * last hour of that day).
