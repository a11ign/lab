// no-token: pure -- both readings are functions of values handed in; the one disk read (`readDeclaredCopies`) is given a fake `list`/`read` or reads this checkout's own files, and nothing here calls `gh`, ssh or the fleet.
/**
 * `packages/agent-org/src/org-health.mjs`, #2937: TWO MORE QUESTIONS THE GATE ASKS ABOUT THE ORG -- a fleet that has captured nothing for a day while something waits for it,
 * and two copies of the same file that have stopped being the same.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLD IS WRITTEN OUT AS 24 HOURS HERE, NEVER AS `FLEET_IDLE_HOURS`: a test built from the constant moves with it (`org-health.test.ts`'s rule, for its reason).
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROLS. The idle fleet is replayed as the chairman described it: zero captures for 4.9 days with a `fleet-gated` row waiting. The copies' control is the REAL
 * `isolation-gate.mjs` pair, read from this checkout, with ONE BYTE changed: every "does not trip" below is only worth anything because that does. The real pairs
 * are read clean first, so the control is not true for the wrong reason.
 *
 * MUTATIONS, each run by hand and each recorded on the row: drop the `something is waiting` condition from `fleetIdleReading` (the idle-nobody-needs test goes red and
 * only it), and compare a pair with itself in `judgePair` (the control goes red, and the "differs" test with it).
