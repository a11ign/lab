// THE ARGV `updatePrimary` ISSUES, OWNED IN ONE PLACE — because it was owned in two and that cost a
// merge-blocking red.
//
// `update-primary.test.ts` asserted the ORDER of the verbs and `primary-checkout-guard.test.ts` asserted
// the full argument lists. Both were correct, neither knew about the other, and when `moveLocalMain`
// added a fourth call on 2026-09-09 the first was updated and the second was found by CI (`not ok 652`).
// A fact stated twice, and the copy that survived was the one nobody was looking at.
//
// The two questions are still different and both are still asked — one file wants the shape of the
// sequence, the other wants every flag — but they are now two readings of ONE list. Adding a call to
// `updatePrimary` fails both until this constant moves, and moving this constant satisfies both at once.
//
// NOT DERIVED FROM `update-primary.mjs`. A list read out of the source it describes asserts that the code
// equals itself, which is the tautology a pinned-argv test exists to avoid. This is a WRITTEN expectation
// that a human has to change deliberately, and the deliberateness is the point.

/**
 * Every git command `updatePrimary` runs, in order, when the shared `main` is already at the target.
 *
 * The last entry is `moveLocalMain` asking where `refs/heads/main` is. Under a stub that answers every
 * `rev-parse` with the same sha it stops there, because the branch needs no move; the BEHIND and DIVERGED
 * paths add `merge-base` and `update-ref` after it and are driven in `update-primary.test.ts`.
