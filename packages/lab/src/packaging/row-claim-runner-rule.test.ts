/**
 * RULE: A `fleet-gated` ROW'S `lane:` LABEL IS SATISFIED BY ANY MEMBER OF ITS ROUTED POOL -- #1828,
 * ceo's ruling on #1817, NARROWED TO ONE NAME BY #2506. `row-file.mjs`'s `fleetOrLabAcceptance` force-adds
 * `lane:orchestrator` to any row whose Acceptance reaches the fleet or the lab. The pool was two names
 * (`orchestrator`, `worker-capture`) and `worker-capture` is retired, so the shipped pool is `orchestrator`
 * alone and a generic engineer is refused: fleet-gated throughput is `orchestrator`'s own turn rate until
 * `orchestrator` shows a `lab:job` dispatch from an engineer cannot collide with another capture, and the
 * exception then attaches to a ROW, not to a name. This reads `ROUTED_TO["fleet-gated"]` directly (from
 * `work-gate.mjs`), never a second copy of the pool, so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * THE POOL-EXEMPTION BRANCH (`pool.includes(owner) && pool.includes(mySession)`) NEEDS TWO MEMBERS TO FIRE, and
 * the shipped pool has one. Its positive control is the `pool` seam on `laneReason`'s `deps`: the cases tagged
 * "TWO-NAME POOL" hand it a pool of two and are what stops the exemption being dead code with no test.
 *
 * PLAIN `lane:` SEMANTICS ARE UNCHANGED EVERYWHERE ELSE: a `lane:ceo` row still refuses every session
 * outside `ceo` unconditionally, because `ceo` is not a member of any `ROUTED_TO` pool.
