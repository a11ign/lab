/**
 * `shadow-gate.mjs` is the rehearsal instrument for ADR 0040 decision 5 (row #2622, child 4 of #69): a
 * read-only runner that feeds a live gate and a candidate gate the SAME reads and diffs their orders, tick
 * for tick, and a second mode that replays a recorded sequence of ticks across a simulated cut-over on a
 * COPY of the state directory. The extracted gate does not exist yet (that is child 5, #2623) -- this
 * proves the INSTRUMENT against injected fixture gates, which is exactly what it must still do once the
 * extraction lands.
 *
 * Every fixture below writes REAL files to a real temp directory and reads them back with `wake.mjs`'s
 * own formats (`ledgerLine`, `VOIDED`, `queueHandoff`, `readHandoffs`) rather than inventing a shape --
 * so "the marker crossed the cut" and "the handoff was still there" are checks against the format the
 * live ledger and queue actually use, not a stand-in for it.
