 * resolves to THE PRIMARY'S `dist` — CLAUDE.md states it, and `docs/operational-lessons.md` records the
 * afternoon spent finding that "resolves to dist" does not say whose. So a fast-forward advances the
 * SOURCE nine worktrees compile against while leaving the COMPILED OUTPUT wherever it last was.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-09: the orchestrator's DOCS-ONLY push was refused by the pre-push hook on a module
 * `main` has and the primary's `dist` did not. A docs change, refused by a resolution failure, in a
 * worktree that had never been anything but current — and nothing in the message could point at the
 * primary, because the primary was not what they had touched.
 *
 * The build belongs IN the update rather than beside it: anything a human has to remember is something
 * that does not happen, and `primary:update` is already the one sanctioned way to move this checkout
 * (#126), which makes it the only place this can live and be reached every time.
