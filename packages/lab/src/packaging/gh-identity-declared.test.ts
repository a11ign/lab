// no-token: gh -- every `gh` spawn named or fixtured below is a STRING inside a fixture or a comment, never
// a real invocation: this file reads `hosts.yml` fixtures and walks the local import closure with its own
// small copy of `host-units.mjs`'s `ghSpawnReachedFrom` (see that function's own header for why this file
// keeps its own rather than importing it), and makes no network call and starts no `gh` process.
//
// #1984: "32 scripts spawn gh and none can say which account they are about to act as."
//
// THIS FILE COVERS BOTH HALVES OF THE ROW. First, `declaredGhAccount` itself (done-when 1): every branch
// `packages/agent-org/host/gh` -- the routing wrapper installed as `~/.local/bin/gh` -- takes, read off the
// SAME three facts (an explicit `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID` against `host.json`'s leads list, and
// the human fallback), never a restated conclusion. Second, done-when 3's guard: the population, and a
// scope decision this row has to make explicitly rather than leave implicit.
//
// **THE SCOPE DECISION (read this before touching the population test below):** the row's Region is five
// files -- `gh-identity.mjs`, `api-pool.mjs`, `work-gate.mjs`, this file and `work-gate.test.ts` -- and does
// NOT include any of the ~30 files that actually spawn `gh` today (`board-data.mjs`, `pr-open.mjs`,
// `wake.mjs`, and so on). Editing them would be OUT OF REGION (`packages/agent-org/docs/roles/engineer.md`:
// "a finding outside your row's Region goes to the row or the owner, never into your diff"), and there is
// no shared `gh`-spawning helper today for the seam to reach through in one edit -- each of those files
// defines its OWN local `const gh = (args) => execFileSync("gh", args, ...)`. So "a guard... that makes
// reaching it non-optional" cannot mean "every population member imports `gh-identity.mjs`" without either
// violating the Region or landing dozens of unreviewed, untested edits in one sitting -- and "never land a
// red test to prove a point" (the same role brief) forbids shipping a guard that is red on arrival because
// the population it just discovered has not been wired yet.
//
// **What this guard actually asserts instead:** the population is real and non-empty (the POSITIVE
// CONTROL an emptiness assertion always needs -- `guards-and-assertions.md`), split by the ENVIRONMENT each
// entry point runs in (the row's own instruction: "decides membership by the environment the entry point
// actually runs in"). Two environments are ALREADY governed by narrower checks and are named rather than
// silently dropped: a `packages/cli/src/action/` file runs as a GitHub Actions step, where `GH_TOKEN`
// decides and `gh-token-jobs.test.ts` already requires it; anything under `packages/control/` or
// `packages/lab/` is the fleet or the corpus, owned by their own nested `CLAUDE.md` and out of an
// engineer's reach by the resource ban. What is LEFT -- "agent-host": the interactive, session-run scripts
// #1974's own excerpt named as the wider half of this class -- is where `declaredGhAccount` is the only
// answer there is, and the guard's REAL assertion is that the seam actually WORKS for the conditions those
// scripts run under, checked LIVE against this host's real `host.json` and real `gh` config directories,
// not a fixture (`docs/operational-lessons.md`'s "run new gate code live once" lesson). If either config
// directory ever loses its `hosts.yml`, THIS test goes red -- which is the guard's whole job: it fails when
// the population's answer stops being answerable, not when a file has not yet been individually wired.
// Wiring each of the ~30 files to name the account on ITS OWN error path (question 1's "report on the
// refusal path" answer, already done for `work-gate.mjs`'s `CANNOT ASK`) is real, sizeable follow-up work
// this row does not attempt, and is reported as such rather than claimed done.
