// no-token: gh -- this file imports only `claimedRowSession`/`rowCallCountSignals`/`rowCallCountOrders`
// from `work-gate.mjs`, three pure functions that never call or spawn `gh`; `claudeTurns` from
// `token-audit.mjs` and `CLAIM_RECORD_MARKER` from `claim-labels.mjs` are pure, leaf modules for the same
// reason. The token charge belongs to the rest of `work-gate.mjs`'s exports, which this test never reaches.
// #2691: the chairman's token-efficiency reading (#928) asks for a LIVE signal, read from the transcripts
// the org already writes, naming a claimed row whose session has passed ~100 calls -- a split CANDIDATE
// for `product-manager`'s judgement, never an automatic split. The read reuses `token-audit.mjs`'s own
// `claudeTurns`/`transcriptFiles`/`summarise` (the same three `split-baseline.mjs` already imports) rather
// than a second transcript parser.
// #2710: the count is now WINDOWED to calls made while a row was actually held -- from its own claim
// record's `createdAt` up to whichever comes first, now or the same session's NEXT claim -- rather than
// the claiming session's whole lifetime. A STANDING seat (`ceo`, `orchestrator`, `product-manager`) holds
// several rows in sequence or at once; without the window, every row it holds reports the identical
// lifetime total, which is the live defect this file's newest cases pin.
//
// Every case is run against a fixture with the fault PRESENT and one without it, so a checker that finds
// nothing to check cannot pass (the emptiness's positive control).
