 * nowhere. It counted every delivery a key had ever had -- so when `ceo/ready-row-unclaimed/1452` spent
 * all six of its deliveries in the morning while B4 genuinely blocked the row behind an open PR, and that
 * PR then merged, the row became claimable and the cap kept it silent for the rest of the day. It was the
 * queue's ONLY actionable job; eight agents sat idle behind it.
 *
 * A TIME WINDOW WAS TRIED FIRST AND CANNOT WORK: those six deliveries span 2h10m, because each waits out
 * the 20-minute liveness TTL, so any window wide enough for the cap to trigger still contains them. The
 * signal is not age. It is whether the cause STOPPED being true and started again -- and from the ledger
 * alone, a gap in DELIVERY is indistinguishable from a gap in EMISSION. So emission is written down.
