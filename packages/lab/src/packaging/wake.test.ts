/**
 * `packages/agent-org/src/wake.mjs` -- #912's remaining half: work-gate says there is work, this says who
 * takes it.
 *
 * DRIVEN THROUGH INJECTED SEAMS, never a running org. Every export here takes its `run` or its reader as a
 * parameter, so these tests answer "given these agent states and these orders, who gets woken and what is
 * refused" -- which is this module's whole question. Standing up herdr to ask it would test herdr.
 *
 * WITH ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION, AT THE FOOT OF THIS FILE: three tests spawn `wake.mjs` as a process with
 * a stub `herdr` on `PATH`. They exist because a seam is exactly what a DELETED CALL goes around -- a
 * reviewer removed the tick's only `backlogReport(handoffBacklog(...))` call and every test above stayed
 * green. Nothing there starts an agent either; the stub answers one question with one literal.
 *
 * The cases that matter are the REFUSALS. A wake that fires is visible immediately; a wake that silently
 * does not is the 2026-09-08 shape the lead-orchestrator brief records, where "every session went idle at
 * 20:52Z and nothing woke anyone for ten" hours.
