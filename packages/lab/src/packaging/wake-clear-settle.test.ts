/**
 * #2546: THE CLEAR'S FIVE-SECOND SETTLE IS A SEAM, AND THE PRODUCTION DELAY IS PINNED WHERE A FAST TEST CANNOT MOVE IT.
 *
 * `clearContext` waits `CLEAR_SETTLE_MS` between typing `/clear` and typing the order after it: a MEASURED production
 * delay (0s produced `Unknown command: /clearYou are...` on the live org; 5s has margin). Every test that drove a
 * standing seat's clear through `deliver`, `deliverHandoffs` or `clearThenPrompt` used to pay it for real, which was
 * about 300 of the 929 CPU-seconds the PR gate's test step spent. `sleep` is a dependency of all three now, REAL BY
 * DEFAULT, and the other test files inject a no-op. What keeps that honest is here, in three pins:
 *
 *  1. `CLEAR_SETTLE_MS === 5000`, exactly. `wake.test.ts` used to allow 2s to 15s, which let a fast test lower the
 *     production value and still pass.
 *  2. THE ORDER, driven through `deliver`: `/clear`, wait, sleep(`CLEAR_SETTLE_MS`), then the order. A recording fake
 *     shares one log with `run`, so the position of the sleep is read rather than assumed.
 *  3. THE DEFAULT IS REAL, by the ONE test in the tree that does not inject. A `sleep` that defaulted to a no-op would
 *     make every test fast and the production path silently instant. It costs five seconds on purpose.
