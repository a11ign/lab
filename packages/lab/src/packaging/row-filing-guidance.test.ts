/**
 * #871: THE TWO FILING RULES THAT ARE ABOUT A PARSER, PINNED TO THE PARSER.
 *
 * `docs/row-filing.md` now carries two rules whose whole justification is what a machine does with a
 * section a person wrote: a Region's exclusion sentence DECLARES the path it denies, and an Acceptance
 * saying `npm test` names a command the tokenless, corpus-less acceptance job cannot run.
 *
 * THE FIRST RULE IS AN ASSERTION ABOUT CODE, SO IT IS PINNED TO THE CODE. A rule justified by a parser's
 * behaviour and not pinned to it is a claim nobody re-checks; when `declaredRegionFiles` learns to read
 * negation -- which the guidance explicitly argues against, but which somebody may still do -- this test
 * fails and the guidance is corrected in the same commit rather than quietly becoming false.
 *
 * The measured incident: #848's Region said "`.github/workflows/ready-label-audit.yml` is NOT in this
 * region", `declaredRegionFiles` returned that path anyway, and `fileOverlapReason` refused another
 * session's claim on #849 over a file #848 had no intention of touching.
