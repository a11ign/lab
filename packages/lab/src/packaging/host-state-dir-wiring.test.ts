/**
 * #2799 (child 5c of #2623): THE DRAIN MARKER, THE REVIEWER STATE, THE SHADOW GATE'S LIVE DIRECTORY AND THE WAKE LEDGER READ THE HOST'S
 * `stateDir`, not a hard-coded `~/.cache/a11ign` -- with the running unit untouched.
 *
 * #2793 (child 5b) gave `host.json` a `stateDir` and the reader `stateFilePath`, and four constants went on spelling a11ign's directory:
 * `DRAIN_MARKER` and `REVIEWER_STATE_DIR` (`work-gate.mjs`), `LIVE_STATE_DIR` (`shadow-gate.mjs`) and `ledgerPathFrom`'s default
 * (`wake.mjs`). Until they read the host's, #2623's cut-over would point `host.json` at the installed tool while the gate, the drain marker,
 * the reviewer state and the wake ledger still read a11ign's directory.
 *
 * **It changes nothing that runs.** a11ign's `host.json` declares no `stateDir`, so each of the four resolves to the string it always did
 * (asserted below against the real modules under the real `host.json`, and under a fixture with none). Editing a11ign's `host.json` is
 * #2623's cut-over, not this row's.
 *
 * THE FOUR ARE READ BY IMPORTING THEM in a child process whose `AGENT_ORG_HOST` names a fixture, because three of them are constants
 * computed at import and a test that re-derived them would be reading its own copy of the derivation.
