 * #1290: the board edition publishes as a GitHub Discussion, not a PDF on a draft release.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, AND THE SECOND FAILS SILENTLY. The edition must BE a Discussion, and the release path must have
 * STOPPED. A Discussion appearing is not evidence of the second, so this file asserts both: the carrier's
 * behaviour against a fake `gh` (asserted on the argv it was handed, not on what it returned), and the
 * workflow's own text, where a re-added `--release` or `contents: write` would restart the release path with
 * every run still green.
