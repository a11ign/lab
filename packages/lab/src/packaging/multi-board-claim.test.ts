/**
 * #2617 (child 3b of #69): THE CLAIM RULES, B4 AND `pr-open` READ EVERY REPOSITORY THE PROJECT DECLARES.
 *
 * One fixture per claim the row makes, each with the control that shows it is not passing by refusing (or accepting) everything:
 *   1. B4 across two code repositories: an overlap that lives ONLY in the second is REFUSED, naming the repository and the pull request;
 *      the same claim with only the first declared PASSES.
 *   2. A Region path with a repository prefix is that key's path, and a bare path is the first repository's -- in BOTH directions, so a
 *      reader that ignored the prefix (or the bareness) fails one of the two.
 *   3. A failed read of the second repository is INCONCLUSIVE, said aloud with the repository's name, and never printed as "no overlap".
 *   4. The same row number in two trackers is two worktree names and two `session:` labels, and the first tracker's are today's, byte for byte.
 *   5. The merge-blocking parser and `pr-open` ACCEPT `Closes a11ign/a11ign#7` and REFUSE the malformed cross-repository forms.
 * And the cost the row's closing comment reports: how many `gh` calls a claim's reads spend per declared repository.
