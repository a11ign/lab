/**
 * TAKING A HOLD MUST NOT SUCCEED SILENTLY OVER SOMEBODY ELSE'S (#266).
 *
 * `gh pr edit --add-label` is idempotent, so taking a PR another session holds succeeds and prints the
 * same nothing as taking a free one. That is this repo's most-recorded shape — an operation whose
 * success says nothing about what it did — so the decision is a pure function with three distinct
 * outcomes, and the two that matter cannot be produced on demand against a live API.

// `gh` helper is reached by the closure walk because it lives in the same module, never because these
// tests call it: `takeHold` and `releaseHold`, the two functions that do, appear in this file only
// inside an assertion message. The declaration is verified against the entry's own code, so a wrong one
// is refused as its own state rather than trusted.

 *     #268 is now held by dispatcher.

 * who no longer thought they held it. `--steal` exists because `--add-label` is idempotent and therefore
 * says nothing about what happened; the fix said nothing about what happened either.
 *
 * The tests above could not have caught it — they exercise the DECISION and the defect was in the WRITE.
 * `displaces` is what makes the write checkable here; the command also reads the labels back afterwards,
