 * #1275: THE SCOPED HALF OF A BOARD SNAPSHOT, TESTED WITHOUT `board-snapshot.mjs` -- which is this file's reason to
 * exist. That script runs `gh`, so any test importing it needs a `token` CI's acceptance job does not have, and
 * #1275's first Acceptance command was refused for exactly that. This file imports the pure module, its pure consumer
 * (`settle-closed-status.mjs`) and the closure walk that refused; the first two tests hold that line.
 *
 * The three CAPTURED responses are what `TOUCHED_ITEM_QUERY` itself returned live on 2026-09-13 (gh 2.100.0),
 * verbatim. THE ASSERTIONS ARE ON THE REQUESTS, as #852's are: a snapshot's contents cannot show what reading it cost.
