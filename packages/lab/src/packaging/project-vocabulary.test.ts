/**
 * #2619 (child 3d of #69): THE PROJECT'S VOCABULARY -- the row template's field names and the
 * label/milestone/lane-prefix/shared-resource words the machinery reads (ADR 0040, decision 1, surface 2),
 * read from `.agent-org/project.json`'s `vocabulary` key by `project-vocabulary.mjs`.
 *
 * Four claims, each with its control in this file:
 *   1. a11ign's declaration, read through the reader, gives EXACTLY today's values for every label,
 *      milestone, lane/session/answer prefix, template field, the `Fleet` question and every shared-resource
 *      pattern -- one assertion per constant, including each of the row's own nine labels.
 *   2. a walk of `packages/agent-org/src` finds NO quoted status word, `lane:`/`session:`/`answer:` prefix
 *      or milestone title as a real CODE literal outside the vocabulary module -- the ratchet ADR 0040
 *      measured at 43 files and this row promised to end at 0. Comments are stripped first, this repo's own
 *      convention (`local-import-closure.mjs`'s `stripComments`): a comment MENTIONING a word is not the
 *      same defect as CODE reading it. A handful of exact, counted, reasoned collisions remain and are
 *      named below, never silently absorbed.
 *   3. a SECOND project's vocabulary, run through the same reader, changes what `row-file.mjs` refuses (a
 *      milestone it does not have, a label outside its set), what `row-claim/runner-rule.mjs`'s lane rule
 *      reads, and, with an empty `resources` list, what `acceptance-commands.mjs` would let an Acceptance
 *      run -- through the injectable seams those three files now carry for exactly this reason, mirroring
 *      `row-claim/file-overlap-rule.mjs`'s own `deps` pattern. This is what "project-agnostic" means and the
 *      only thing that shows the reader is not a11ign's constants in a trench coat.
 *   4. each field is REFUSED naming it when missing or mistyped, never answered with a11ign's value.
