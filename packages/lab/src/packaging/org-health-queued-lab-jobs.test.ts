// no-token: gh -- importing `work-gate.mjs` reaches `defaultRun` (`execFileSync("gh", ...)`), and this file never lets it run: `orgHealthNow` is handed the clock, the last merge, the fleet reading, the lab-job read and the log.
/**
 * #3007 (found by #2980): `waiting.labJobs` IS READ, so a fleet idle with only a lab job waiting trips.
 *
 * `labJobRecordsOrSay` reads the jobs that ENDED, so `labJobs` was always `[]` and "nothing waits" and "not asked" looked the same. The read
 * under test is `readDispatchedLabJobs`: the `ansible-playbook ... lab-job.yml` processes on this host, which live exactly as long as a
 * dispatch does. The tests here run `orgHealthNow` itself, the only place the omission could be caught.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL is the first test: zero captures for 24 h, nothing else waiting, ONE job dispatched and not ended, and it offers an
 * order. Every "offers nothing" below is only worth something because that one does.
 *
 * MUTATION, run by hand on 2026-10-02 and recorded on the row (each restored byte-identical from a copy): `readDispatchedLabJobs` returning `[]`
 * turns ONLY the first test red (1 of 10); `dispatchedJobNames` taking every non-empty line as a job turns 4 red (the two parsing tests, the
 * "ended" tick and the "not a dispatch" test); `dispatchedJobNames` never matching turns 3 red; `fleetWaitingFacts` reading a refused job read
 * as `[]` turns 2 red (the refused-read tick and the facts test).
