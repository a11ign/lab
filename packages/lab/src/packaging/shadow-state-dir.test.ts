/**
 * #2623 DONE-WHEN 6: THE EXTRACTED GATE READS `A11IGN_SHADOW_STATE_DIR`.
 *
 * `decide(args)` has no state-directory parameter, so the shadow-window runner (#2846) hands the candidate its COPY of the state directory
 * through that variable, and "the candidate reads the copy" is true only once the gate's own state paths consult it. They did not: the drain
 * marker, the reviewer state and the shadow gate's live directory are constants computed at import from `stateEntryPath`, and it knew only
 * `host.json`. So the seam is `stateEntryPath`, and three things are pinned:
 *
 *   1. SET AND USABLE: all four readers (`DRAIN_MARKER`, `REVIEWER_STATE_DIR`, `LIVE_STATE_DIR`, the wake ledger) resolve under the copy, ahead
 *      of whatever `host.json` declares.
 *   2. SET AND UNUSABLE REFUSES, naming the path, never falling back. A variable that leaked into the LIVE tick would otherwise move its
 *      drain marker and reviewer state without a word. "Usable" is "carries the marker the runner writes", the runner's own test for a
 *      directory it may empty.
 *   3. UNSET IS TODAY'S BEHAVIOUR (`host-state-dir-wiring.test.ts` pins the strings; here the control is that the copy is NOT among them).
 *
 * The last test runs the runner end to end with the REAL `work-gate.mjs` imported by the candidate, because the first three read the seam and
 * only this one reads the seam as the runner arranges it.
