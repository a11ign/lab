/**
 * #725: AN ARMED PR CARRIES NOTHING SAYING WHOSE IT IS.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-09, 12:30Z: ceo read the open-PR list, found #717 opened seven minutes earlier and
 * armed, and could not say whose it was without three hops -- PR -> branch name -> row number -> row's
 * `session:*` label -- and the last hop only worked because the branch happened to end in its row
 * number. Every worker's branch shares the `agent/*` prefix, so the branch alone never says who.
 *
 * The fix is in the arm path, because `arm-pr.mjs` already has the row's label in hand at exactly the
 * moment it decides whether to arm (#645's hold check reads the PR; this reads the row the PR closes) --
 * one place where the information and the action coincide.
 *
 * THE ROW IS READ FROM THE PR BODY'S `Closes #N`, NEVER FROM THE BRANCH NAME. Deriving it from
 * `agent/…-655` would be the same three-hop guess with fewer steps visible, and wrong for any branch
 * not ending in its row number -- so these tests drive `closedRowNumbers` from body text, never a
 * branch, and there is no branch-name parsing anywhere in `arm-pr.mjs` to accidentally exercise.
