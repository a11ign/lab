// THE CLEAR THAT THE DOCUMENTED PATH SKIPPED.
//
// `wake.mjs` clears a session before every order the gate delivers -- 690k -> 37k input tokens on a real
// session. But `agent-practices.md` told the AUTHOR of a draft to prompt the parity reviewer with a raw
// `herdr --session org agent prompt`, which never passes through `wake.mjs` and therefore never clears.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-19 on a real `reviewer` transcript: six reviews in one unbroken session -- #1765,
// #1767, #1769, #1771, #1775, #1777 -- of which only #1765 arrived through the gate. 2.29M cached input
// tokens carried, at least one auto-compact. Five of the six prompts were the documented path.
