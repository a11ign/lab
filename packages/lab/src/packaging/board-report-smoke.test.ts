// no-token: REPO
// This file imports board-report.mjs, whose closure reads REPO from board-data.mjs, which spawns `gh`. Every test here
// renders from an injected fact set and, since #1442, an injected instant; nothing here calls or spawns it.
/**
 * Guard triage 4 of 6 (#906): the board's content/style guards retire with the org shape they policed.
 * What survives is this — that the board report renders at all — because a render failure is a defect a
 * reader catches slower than a build does, and the render is what a person reads before anything of the
 * board's is published. Everything the deleted tests asserted about WORDING, CAPS and SECTION DETAIL is
 * now the product-manager's own read of the rendered document, per the CI Reset's own risk acceptance:
 * "the style guards were catching a class of defect a reader catches faster, and they cost every pull
 * request to do it."
 *
 * See docs/operational-lessons.md, "Guard triage 4 of 6", for what each retired test asserted and why.
