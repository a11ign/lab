/**
 * #2621 (child 3e of #69): ROLE BRIEFS AND GATE CAUSES ARE A PROJECT'S DECLARATION (ADR 0040, decision 1,
 * surface 3). Two claims, each with its control in this file:
 *
 *   1. A CAUSE IS ONE DECLARATION, `{cause, group, profile}` (`cause-shape.mjs`/`cause-declaration.mjs`), so
 *      `CAUSES`, `JUDGMENT_CAUSES`, `START_CAUSES` and `PROFILES` are COMPUTED from a list of them rather
 *      than four hand-maintained lists. Measured (ADR 0040's own reading, at `46b59abf0`): 29 causes, ONE
 *      routing to the fleet (`fleet-batch-due`) -- so 28 were the tool's own code and 1 a plugin. Two tool
 *      causes landed after that snapshot (`pr-codeowner-review-missing` #1959, `row-call-count-signal`
 *      #2691), so TODAY's classification is **30 tool / 1 project (N=1, at most 2)**, re-derived below
 *      rather than trusted from the stale snapshot -- this row's own convention for a quoted count.
 *   2. A ROLE BRIEF IS READ FROM THE PROJECT'S DECLARED DIRECTORY (`project-roles.mjs`), not a path baked
 *      into the tool: `.agent-org/project.json`'s `roles.dir` names it, a missing directory is REFUSED
 *      naming it, and the tool's own tree (`packages/agent-org/`) ships none.
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROL: the a11ign cause list is asserted to contain `fleet-batch-due`, so a declaration that
 * lost it (moved to the plugin but never wired back in) cannot equal the recorded lists.
