/**
 * #411: A MERGE CAN DELETE WORK ALREADY ON `main`, AND EVERY CHECK PASSES.
 *
 * `unexplainedDeletions` is the whole decision, as one pure function. The discovery of its discriminator
 * -- a deleted path is EXPLAINED only when a non-merge commit unique to the branch actually touched it --
 * was verified against BOTH real commits in this repository's own history before being written down here:
 * `f2cdfaf3` (the incident: a deletion no branch commit ever mentions) and `fc9b89d2` (#354, a deliberate
 * consolidation: a real commit, `ca922204`, names the deletion). See trunk-revert-guard.mjs's own header
 * for why the more obvious instruments -- `git merge-tree` on the merge's own two parents, and GitHub's
 * `gh pr view --json files` -- both FAIL to distinguish the two, because the loss happened several commits
 * deep inside the branch's own internal main-sync history, not at the outermost merge.
 */
// requires: history
//
// #497. Every spawn below runs the guard against two REAL merges -- `f2cdfaf3` (the incident) and
// `fc9b89d2` (#354's documented legitimate deletion). The acceptance job checks out at depth 1,
// deliberately (`reusable-acceptance.yml`: "NO `fetch-depth: 0` HERE"), and a shallow checkout does not
// contain them:
//
//     fatal: ambiguous argument 'fc9b89d2': unknown revision or path not in the working tree
//
// Measured on #895's own acceptance run, 2026-09-09. NOT caused by the clone #890 introduced -- a clone
// of a shallow repository is shallow, and `cwd: REPO` against the same checkout fails identically.
// Naming this file in an acceptance command for the first time is what made a standing requirement
// visible; these tests could never have run there.
//
// The declaration is what turns that git failure into a refusal BY NAME, before the spawn, and lets a PR
// that needs them deepen the checkout with `History: full`.

// no-token: gh
//
// #827. `trunkRedOrders` takes its facts as an argument and returns the order -- `readTrunkRed`, in
// `trunk-red.mjs`, does the lookups -- and this file calls the first with a fixture. The closure walk reaches
// `gh` through that module's graph rather than through anything these tests execute.
//
// The spawned script runs `git`, not `gh`, and since #890 it runs against a local clone rather than the
// checkout hosting the suite.
//
// Verified against the entry's own code by #827's mechanism, so if `trunkRedOrders` ever starts doing its
// own lookups this refuses rather than trusting the comment.

 * `trunk-revert-guard.mjs` runs `git fetch origin --quiet` before it looks at anything (line ~145,
 * unconditional, and deliberately so -- worker-contracts' finding that the guard must not read a
 * remote-tracking ref that a checkout happens to have fetched an hour ago). Every spawn below used to
 * pass `cwd: REPO`, which resolves to whichever checkout is running the suite -- so a `npm test` in any
 * worktree fetched into the SHARED primary `.git`, writing its remote-tracking refs while another
 * worktree may be doing the same. A test mutating the checkout that drives the fleet, with a lock in the
 * failure mode. #640's class, found by worker-audit from a real collision (#890).
 *
 * `git clone --local --no-hardlinks` COPIES the object store rather than hard-linking it, because a hard
 * link cannot cross filesystems: on a host whose `/tmp` is tmpfs and whose checkout is not (the `agents`
 * host), plain `--local` failed every run with `Invalid cross-device link` before one assertion ran
 * (#1271). macOS and GitHub's runners keep `/tmp` on the root filesystem, which is why it never fired
 * there. The copy is cheap -- 0.30 s and 29 M on `agents`, 2026-09-13 -- and keeps the real history the
 * tests need: `f2cdfaf3` and `fc9b89d2` are documented merges on main, and a synthetic
 * fixture could not stand in for them without inventing the very shapes the guard is being proved
 * against.
 *
 * THE CLONE'S `origin` IS THE PRIMARY, so the script's `fetch` READS it and writes only inside the
 * clone. Reading is not the hazard; the hazard was two writers on one ref namespace.
 *
 * Cloned ONCE for the whole file rather than per test -- four spawns, one clone -- and removed in
 * `after()`. A clone per spawn would be correct and four times the cost for no extra isolation, since
 * none of these tests writes to it.

 * turned main red for 27 hours from #895's merge (48aef3f2, 2026-09-09 19:11Z): trunk-guard's unscoped
 * build took the shallow checkout, and every later push was declined as INHERITED. #901.
 *
 * So each spawning test asks first whether the fixture is present, and SKIPS BY NAME when it is not --
 * the same shape `backlog-file-facts.test.ts` uses for a blob the checkout cannot see. A skip is honest
 * where a pass would be a lie and a fail blames the wrong thing; the job that must actually run these is
