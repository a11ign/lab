// no-token: gh -- every `gh` and `herdr` here is an injected `run` seam; nothing imported spawns the real one
/**
 * #2403: the engineer pool has NO CEILING. `sessions.json` declares the spare engineers as ONE FAMILY (`worker-<n>`
 * for n from 4) and, when every address holds a process and a claimable row waits, `spawnableRole` allocates a
 * spare instead of refusing at the list's length (#2469: named for the row, no longer the lowest free number).
 *
 * Its own file, and not a block in `wake.test.ts`, for #2280's reason: that file spawns `route`, which reaches `gh`,
 * so the token-less acceptance job refused it and verified nothing. Every fact read here -- herdr, GitHub, the
 * cycle ledger -- is injected, so the row's declared Acceptance is a command the job can RUN.
 *
 * WHERE THE ACCEPTED CASES' POSITIVE CONTROLS ARE, because an assertion that a label is accepted proves nothing
 * beside a reader that accepts everything: each reader below is also asked for a name INSIDE no family
 * (`worker-3`, below `from`; `worker-09`, a second spelling; `worker-capture-9`, another prefix) and must refuse it.
