// --- #2126: AN UNANSWERED REFUSAL IS WORK NEEDING ACTION, THROUGH `sessionEligibilityReason` -----------

/**
 * B2 caps WORK NEEDING THIS SESSION'S ACTION, and a pull request whose reviewer has asked for changes is
 * exactly that -- it is not waiting on anybody but its author. #989 is untouched and the four cases far
 * above are its positive control: as many pull requests AWAITING REVIEW as it takes, one row in build.
 *
 * `row-claim-own-pr-health-rule.test.ts` owns the pure coverage of the predicate, the dispute reader and
 * the escalation. These prove the WIRING: that `sessionEligibilityReason` actually reaches them, with the
 * one `pr list` call the row asked for and not one per held row.
