/**
 * #2616 (child 3a of #69): THE ONE READER OF A PROJECT'S DECLARATION, `.agent-org/project.json` (ADR 0040, decisions 1 and 2).
 *
 * Three claims, each with its control in this file:
 *   1. a11ign's own declaration, read through the reader, gives EXACTLY today's values, so nothing moved -- and it is
 *      non-empty and holds the empty key exactly once (the control for every "nothing was wrong" reading below);
 *   2. a SECOND project (another owner, repository and board number) gives ITS values through the same reader, which is what
 *      "project-agnostic" means and the only thing that shows the reader is not a11ign's constants in a trench coat;
 *   3. each rule is REFUSED naming the field, and never answered with a11ign's values. Every refusal is a one-change mutation
 *      of a VALID base, so it is shown to fail for the named field and not an unrelated one, and the unmutated base is shown to
 *      pass (the positive control: a base that was itself invalid would make every refusal below true for the wrong reason).
 *
 * The count of non-test files under `packages/agent-org/src` that still carry the repository's name literally is recorded
 * and asserted NOT to grow: each is a surface a later row of #69 moves, and a new one is a surface it must move too.
