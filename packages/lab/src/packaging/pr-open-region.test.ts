// no-token: gh -- `main` here is handed `rowBody`, `git`, `run`, `runAcceptance` and `prHead` as seams, so nothing reaches the real `gh`
/**
 * #2417 (ceo, #928 ruling 3): `pr:open` refuses a diff that leaves the row's Region, and the only way through is a
 * declared `Outside-Region: <path> — <reason>` line. Its own file, and not a block in `pr-open.test.ts`, so that
 * file's coverage is not refused by the token-less acceptance job on this row's account (the row's own
 * Acceptance note, and #2280's reason).
 *
 * THE THREE MEASURED OCCURRENCES ARE REPLAYED at the diff each had when refused, with the Region the row carried when
 * it was refused (read from the rows and the PRs on 2026-09-24; #2167's Region was AMENDED after #2253's refusal to
 * add the fourth path, so the fixture states the three it had):
 *   - #2253, `docs/operational-lessons.md`, at `a308b8b6`. Both reviewers refused it at that one head (22:03:08Z and
 *     22:06:02Z), which is the row's "#2253 twice": one diff, so one fixture.
 *   - #2408, `packages/agent-org/docs/roles/README.md`, at `a0ffb58a`, the round that refused. Its latest review is
 *     `convinced` (at `16f21156`) and it counts here only because that earlier round refused.
