 * `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/...`, which does not exist on the `ubuntu-latest` runner the workflow
 * has run on since it was written. `resolveChromeBinary` replaces that literal with a search: an env-var
 * override, a list of known install locations across both OSes, then a PATH lookup -- each one checked
 * with `existsSync`/`which` rather than executed, so a wrong guess reports "not found" instead of a
 * `spawnSync ... ENOENT` stack trace that names neither the missing browser nor what to do about it.

 *
 * The probe is the real resolver against real disk state. Only `exists` is wrapped, to record which install
 * locations it checked, so the skip names them; the resolver's own message names the PATH names it tried.
