/**
 * #2641: AN `answer:<session>` LABEL ON A PULL REQUEST THAT IS NO LONGER OPEN WAS READ BY NOTHING.
 *
 * `trunkRedOrders` names the MERGED pull request that turned `main` red as its subject, and `escalateStuck` labels
 * it `answer:ceo` when six offers did not clear the red (#2636). The `answer-owed` reader covered open issues, open
 * pull requests (#2492) and closed ISSUES (#2202) -- and no pull request that is not open, so the escalation ended in
 * a label on a merged PR and no session was woken. #2202's defect one subject over.
 *
 * Its own file for #2280's reason: `work-gate.test.ts` reaches `gh`, which the token-less acceptance job refuses.
 *
 * THE FAKE IS GITHUB, NOT A CANNED REPLY. `fakeGitHub` holds issues and pull requests with states and labels and
 * answers `label list`, `issue list` and `pr list` by filtering them the way `gh` does for the arguments the reader
 * sends (`--state`, and `label:"a","b"` with or without `-is:open`). A reader that never asks about pull requests
 * therefore gets no merged PR back, and that is what makes the negative test fail for the defect and not for a
 * mismatched argv. `ignoreLabelSearch` is the same fake with the label filter switched off, so the LOCAL half of the
 * reader (`withAnswerLabel`) is tested apart from the server-side half and neither hides the other's deletion.
