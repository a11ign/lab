 * #466 (C5): conflict metrics, READ FROM THE REPOSITORY rather than reported by a session.
 *
 * ceo's own done-when criteria (p90 under an hour, no PR over four hours, no file touched by more than
 * five PRs, zero conflicts, trunk green on every merge) are unanswerable except by a session asserting
 * them, until something computes them from GitHub and git directly. This is that something.
 *
 * The pure helpers (`percentile`, `mergeLifetimeMinutes`, `hotspotFiles`) are tested against plain
 * fixtures, no network or git needed. `mergedPRNeededReconciliation` calls `git` directly and is tested
 * against REAL commits already in this repository's history — the same idiom `board-report.test.ts` uses
 * for `whatMerged`'s real `git(["rev-parse", ...])` call, rather than mocking a wrapper this file does not
 * make injectable. #1407: `conflictMetrics` is the LIVE entry and
 * no test here calls it. `composeConflictMetrics` is the same composition with the `gh` listing handed in, and it
 * is driven with recorded listings, so a local run makes no `gh` call.

 * #466 was filed to build: a lookup failure is refused, never folded into a false clean. So this checker
 * does NOT wrap the call in a try/catch -- the function never throws here, and the first version of this
 * guard caught nothing, exactly because it was built to catch an exception that this function's own
 * design deliberately never lets escape. It checks the RETURN VALUE instead: `null` is read as "this
 * environment could not tell", the honest skip; anything else is asserted against `expected`.
 *
 * FOUND BY WATCHING IT FAIL TO SKIP, not by reasoning about it -- the first version of this test read
 * `assert.equal(result, true)` inside `skipIfShallow(() => {...})` and failed for real in the `acceptance`
 * job with `null !== true`, never reaching the catch block at all. A guard must be shown to fire before it
 * is trusted, this repository's own rule, and the wrong shape here would have shipped believing it did.
