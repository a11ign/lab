/**
 * #1140: THE ONE TEST THAT ASKS GITHUB WHICH `session:*` LABELS EXIST, MOVED OUT OF `arm-pr.test.ts`.
 *
 * `arm-pr.test.ts` declares `// no-token: gh`, and this test spawned `gh` by string inside it. #827's check read
 * only a call shape (`gh(`), so the declaration held while the file spawned the command it disclaimed; #1140 made
 * the check read a string spawn too, and that file's declaration then refused. The opt-in flag below kept the
 * acceptance job from spawning, but a static check cannot see a flag -- so the test lives here, UNDECLARED, and
 * the parser charges this file `token`, which is the truth about it.
