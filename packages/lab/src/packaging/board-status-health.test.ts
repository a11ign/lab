/**
 * #1219: 311 CLOSED ROWS ADVERTISE A LIVE STATUS, AND THE INSTRUMENT WATCHING FOR IT COULD NOT SEE IT.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-13 across 444 board items, driving the GraphQL query that returns issue STATE rather
 * than `gh project item-list`, which does not carry it:
 *
 * ```
 *  220  In progress / CLOSED
 *   69  Done        / CLOSED
 *   45  Ready       / CLOSED
 *   32  Backlog     / OPEN
 * ```
 *
 * **`Done` is the exception rather than the resting state**, and the board's most populated live column
 * is entirely finished work. A session reading the board to find work reads 220 rows that are done.
 *
 * **HALF THE ROW IS THE INSTRUMENT.** The health check asked `label -> Status` in two directions and
 * never `Status -> label`, so it reported clean while every row disagreed in the direction it did not
 * test. That is #1193's one-directional pin, six hours later, inside the thing watching for it.
 *
 * IMPORTS ONLY THE PURE MODULE, DELIBERATELY. `board-snapshot.mjs` is where this classifier's sibling
 * lives, and its closure carries a `token` -- so a test importing it would make this row's own
 * acceptance command refused in the job that runs acceptance commands. #1009 records that; the remedy
 * is placement, and `deriveClosureRequirements` on the new module returns `[]`.
