/**
 * #416: AUTO-ARM MUST ARM WITH A TOKEN WHOSE EVENTS FIRE.
 *
 * GitHub does not trigger workflows from events created with `GITHUB_TOKEN` -- a merge completed by
 * `github-actions[bot]` fires neither `pull_request: closed` nor a `push`, so `trunk-guard`, `close-rows`
 * and every push watchdog go silent for exactly the merges the pipeline itself performs (measured
 * 2026-09-08, 37 data points, no exceptions). Arming with a real PAT (`A11IGN_BOT_TOKEN`) instead means
 * the completed merge is attributed to that identity and every one of those triggers fires.
 *
 * Creating the token is NOT this row's job -- `ceo` asks the chairman for it. This file asserts the
 * WORKFLOW's own text, because the decision here is bash inside `auto-arm.yml`, not a separate script:
 * both `arm` (the per-PR trigger) and `sweep` (#344's queue sweep) must read the secret when present and
 * fall back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, with a printed warning, when it is not -- so the pipeline keeps arming
 * before the token exists rather than stopping (#382's own lesson: a job that cannot do its intended work
 * must say which path it took).
 *
 * Scoped to EXACTLY these two jobs' own `run:` text, never the whole file -- C2 (#416's sibling) added a
 * THIRD job, `update-branch`, to this same workflow, and it prints its own `A11IGN_BOT_TOKEN is not set`
 * warning for a deliberately DIFFERENT reason (it skips outright rather than falling back -- see that
 * job's own comment). A whole-file regex count would have made this file's assertions couple to a job
 * this file is not about, and either broken a correct third job or hidden a real regression in the two
 * jobs this file actually specifies. See `auto-arm-update-branch.test.ts` for the third job's own tests.

// --- #1969: A TOKEN THAT IS SET BUT REFUSED IS NOT A TOKEN THAT WORKS -------------------------------
//
// The four tests above pin that both jobs BRANCH on whether `A11IGN_BOT_TOKEN` is SET. That branch was
// the whole of the token's story, and on 2026-09-22 it was measured to be the wrong question: the secret
// was set, the branch took the PAT path, and the PAT's GraphQL pool was exhausted from 18:45:53Z to
// 19:13:44Z. Every `pull_request` run of `auto-arm.yml` failed on `arm-pr.mjs`'s label read, and what it
// printed -- `could not read this PR's labels -- REFUSING to arm. Unreadable is not unheld` -- is TRUE,
// COMPLETE, and indistinguishable from the same refusal on a single unreadable pull request.
//
// #1958 and #1949 were approved, convinced, green on every job and `MERGEABLE` for the whole window, and
// NOTHING in the repository could arm either: `arm` and `sweep` are the only two things that arm, and
// both read the one refused credential. They were found because a session was woken about an unrelated
// red check and read the log.
//
// These drive the real entry points rather than asserting on source text -- the rule this file's own
// `MUTATION TARGET` test states, and `a-hold-means-cannot-merge.test.ts` records being caught by.
