 * #1345: A SUMMARY'S AGE IS THE MINUTES THAT PASSED, NOT ITS DISTANCE FROM NOW WITHIN ONE DAY.
 *
 * `statedWritingTime` compared "HH:MM" with "HH:MM", so a summary written at 23:50 and rendered at 00:30 read as
 * 1,400 minutes stale and `requireSummaryIsFresh` refused it. It fails CLOSED -- nothing wrong is published --
 * but the number in the refusal is false, and the only renders in that hour are the post-midnight republish
 * #1302 fixed the date for. No test imported `board-summary-check.mjs` before this file (#1345's Region note).
 *
 * THE INSTANTS ARE UTC AND THE ASSERTIONS ARE LONDON'S. September is BST (UTC+1), December is GMT, so each case
 * says which London wall clock its instant is.
