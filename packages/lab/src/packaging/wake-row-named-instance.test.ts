/**
 * #2469: an engineer spawned for row N is `worker-N` (`ceo`'s ruling on #2407, section 2). The allocator used to
 * hand out the LOWEST free counter, and a counter name was reused across unrelated rows (`worker-4` held six), so
 * nobody reading the ledger or a herdr list could tell which row a name meant. A spare holds ONE row (#2407), so
 * the row is the name.
 *
 * Its own file, and not a block in `wake-spare-family.test.ts`, so the row's Acceptance is one command that names
 * exactly this. Every fact read here -- herdr, GitHub, the cycle ledger, the registry -- is injected or a temp file.
 *
 * WHERE THE POSITIVE CONTROLS ARE, because "refused" and "not renamed" are absences that pass against a function
 * that does nothing: the taken-address cases each run beside the SAME call with the address free (which spawns),
 * and the counter-named case runs beside a spawn in the same tick that does start a row-named instance.
