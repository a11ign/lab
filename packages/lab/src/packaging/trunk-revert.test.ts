/**
 * A RED `main` WAKES A FIXER, AND NOTHING REVERTS ANYTHING -- #2356, the chairman's ruling of 2026-09-24:
 * THE ORG ALWAYS FIXES FORWARD.
 *
 * THE FILE KEEPS THE NAME IT HAD WHEN IT TESTED THE REVERT, because the row's Region and Acceptance name it
 * and a rename is a second change nobody asked for. What it pins is the replacement:
 *
 *   1. A failing `trunkBuildTest` (or `trunkGate`) on main's tip emits ONE order, naming the test, the run and
 *      the merge, saying "fix forward" -- whether the parent re-check calls the failure this merge's own,
 *      inherited, or could not say.
 *   2. Own or unknown goes to the session that merged it, falling back to `engineers` when that session is
 *      gone; inherited goes straight to `engineers`, because nothing about it is the merged PR's own.
 *   3. It is the FIRST order `decide` emits, and a drain does not withhold it.
 *   4. THE POLICY that was asked to be decided is written down (`RED_TRUNK_POLICY`) and pinned here.
 *   5. NO WORKFLOW opens a `revert/` branch or pull request, calls `git revert`, or holds the grants one
 *      would need, and the script that did is gone.
 *
 * The two real near-misses the old decision was built around still matter, now as attribution rather than as
 * a gate on action: 13 of 19 PRs read red on one bad commit and none was at fault (#316), and a parent
 * measured green sixty-one minutes earlier failed a wall-clock assertion when asked again (#616).
