// no-token: gh -- reaches `fileOverlapReason` through `row-claim/file-overlap-rule.mjs`, whose own `lookup*` readers spawn `gh`; nothing here calls one (#2542)
/**
 * #2542: THE B4 POSITIVE CONTROL OF THE `work-gate.mjs` SPLIT.
 *
 * The split exists because B4 (`row-claim/file-overlap-rule.mjs`) compares a row's Region against the files of open
 * pull requests, so two org fixes that both name `work-gate.mjs` serialise even when they edit different orders.
 * Moving the pull-request orders into `work-gate/pr-orders.mjs` only helps if a Region NAMING that module is still
 * a Region B4 reads. This is the control: two Regions that both name the module DO collide, so a fix to one of its
 * orders waits behind another fix to one of its orders, and behind nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. The negative half -- two Regions naming two DIFFERENT family modules do not collide --
 * needs a second family module and lands with the row that extracts it (#2542's Done-when 2). Until then this is
 * the only half a single module can support, and it is not evidence that the split reduces collisions.
