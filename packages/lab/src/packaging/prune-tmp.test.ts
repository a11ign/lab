/**
 * #2166: THE GUARD FOR `prune-tmp.mjs` -- and the half that matters is the REFUSALS.
 *
 * The row this file closes was filed because a 16G RAM-backed `/tmp` reached 80% and a write failed with
 * `disk quota exceeded`, while the root disk read 47%. The obvious remedy -- a sweep keyed to `rv-*` --
 * sees 3 of 240 review leftovers and none of the 6.2G of dead session scratchpads that actually filled it.
 *
 * So there are two jobs here, and only one of them is easy:
 *
 * 1. **REMOVABLE, BY NAME.** A leftover whose pull request is closed, and a scratchpad no authority can
 *    find a live session behind, classify `remove` -- with the reason quoted, not merely counted.
 * 2. **REFUSED, BY NAME, WITH THE REASON QUOTED.** A live session's scratchpad and an open pull request's
 *    clone are refused. Without this half the file is `rm -rf /tmp/rv-*` wearing a better name, and the
 *    first thing it would delete is the scratchpad of whichever session ran it -- which is not a
 *    hypothetical: a session's CURRENT uuid is named by no process at all on this host (measured
 *    2026-09-23; six live `claude` processes, every argv uuid 7-9h cold).
 *
 * ## Every fixture is a real directory under a disposable root, and the process half uses a real process
 *
 * Nothing below reads or writes the real `/tmp` families: each test builds its own root under
 * `mkdtempSync` and hands that root to the tool, which is structurally unable to reach the host's
 * scratchpads from there. The one place a stub would have proved nothing -- "is this path held open by a
 * running process" -- SPAWNS A REAL PROCESS holding a real fd, and reads the answer through the real
 * `/proc`.
 *
 * ## A COUNT IS NOT A READ-BACK (#2012)
 *
 * The would-remove count read 79 before a change and 79 after it, with different membership, because the
 * population moved between runs minutes apart. Both populations here move faster than that. So every
 * assertion below names a PATH and quotes the reason the classifier gave for it; no assertion watches a
 * total, and the two that do count (the `rv-*` blind-spot control) compare two sets over the SAME fixture
 * in the same moment.
