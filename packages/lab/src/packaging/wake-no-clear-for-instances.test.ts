 * #2483: A PER-ROW INSTANCE IS NEVER `/clear`ed (chairman, via `ceo`, 2026-09-25). A spawned `worker-<n>` and a
 * `reviewer-<n>` have one row as their whole life, so a failing check or a refusal on THEIR pull request is the same
 * task and not an unrelated topic; wiping the window discards exactly what the order is about.
 *
 * THERE ARE TWO CLEAR PATHS AND EACH IS DRIVEN HERE: `deliver` (the gate's, and a queued handoff's through
 * `deliverHandoffs`) and `clearThenPrompt` (every `prompt:session`, reached here through its CLI as well as directly).
 * The controls sit in the SAME file: `ceo`, `product-manager`, `orchestrator` and `worker-tooling` are still cleared
 * on both paths, because a predicate that matches everything passes the instance half by clearing nothing.
 *
 * A clear costs five seconds (`CLEAR_SETTLE_MS`), so the control tests hold the file's runtime.
