/**
 * #2618 (child 3c of #69): THE GATE AND WAKE ENUMERATE EVERY REPOSITORY THE PROJECT DECLARES, AND A SEAT NAME CANNOT COLLIDE ACROSS TWO.
 *
 * ADR 0040, decision 2. A pull request or row number is only unique WITHIN a repository, so with a second one declared `reviewer-7` names two
 * pull requests and `engineers/ready-row-unclaimed/7` names two rows -- one ledger key, so a `RESET` written for one would silence the other.
 * The grammar, and where each half is asserted below:
 *
 *   name        `<role>-<n>` for the EMPTY key (the primary project's first repository), `<role>-<key>-<n>` otherwise
 *   ledger key  the bare `<n>` for the empty key, `<key>#<n>` otherwise -- so the primary's wake ledger, its `VOIDED` markers and the handoff queue
 *               are read by the new code with NO conversion and by the old code unchanged, which is what makes a rollback a unit edit
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROLS ARE IN THIS FILE, AND EACH NAMES THE ASSERTION IT SERVES (`.claude/rules/guards-and-assertions.md`). Every "distinct" claim is
 * made over a NON-EMPTY population: the recorded fixture, the ledger sample, the two-scope order lists and the second tracker's ready rows each
 * carry an explicit `length > 0` before anything is compared to them, so a gate that emitted nothing cannot equal an empty fixture.
