/**
 * #2636: A STUCK ROW IS `ceo`'S TO UNSTICK, NOT THE CHAIRMAN'S. `escalateStuck` labelled every cause that six deliveries
 * did not clear `needs:chairman`, which now means only what the chairman alone can do (an account, admin, money, a legal
 * act). It labels `answer:ceo` instead: the org's own "a named session owes an answer here", read by the `answer-owed`
 * cause, cleared by removing it.
 *
 * Its own file for #2280's reason (`wake.test.ts` reaches `gh`, so the token-less acceptance job refuses it).
 *
 * The negative test (no chairman label) and the positive control (the ceo label IS set on the same call) share ONE
 * fixture, so the negative cannot pass for an escalation that never happens. Mutate `ESCALATION_LABEL` back to
 * `CHAIRMAN_LABEL` and the negative goes red; delete the `run(...)` call and the control does.
