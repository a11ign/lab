/**
 * #1830: THE FIRING MUST NEVER REPORT "EXAMINED 0" AS "ALL ROWS COVERED" -- the row's own Mutation.
 * `examinedComment([], ...)` is the direct pin. `fleetGatedRows` throwing rather than returning `[]` on a
 * refused `gh` call is `work-gate.test.ts`'s own rule (`readPrs`/`readReadyRows` never coerce a refusal
 * to an empty queue) applied to this firing's one read.
