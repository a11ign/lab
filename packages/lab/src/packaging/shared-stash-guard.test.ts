/**
 * THE STASH IS SHARED ACROSS WORKTREES, AND THE FIXTURE HAS TO BE TOO (#290).
 *
 * `orchestrator` stashed their own change, checked out `origin/main` to test whether a failure was
 * pre-existing, switched back, and `git stash pop` returned **somebody else's uncommitted work** — a
 * 95-line diff plus a new test file, with nothing on it saying whose it was. Their own stash was consumed
 * in the same operation.
 *
 * **A ONE-WORKTREE FIXTURE CANNOT EXPRESS THIS.** The row says so and it is the thing to get right: the
 * fault IS that `refs/stash` is in the common git dir, so a test in a single repository would pass
 * whatever the guard did. Every test here builds a real repository with a real second worktree and
 * drives real `git stash` through the real hook.
 *
 * WHY `reference-transaction`. Git has no pre-stash hook and `pre-commit` cannot see a stash — a stash is
 * a ref update, not a commit. This is the only hook that observes one, and exiting non-zero in the
 * `prepared` phase aborts the transaction with the working tree untouched. Measured before the guard was
 * written, because it decided the design.
