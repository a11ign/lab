/**
 * #2256: a session OUT OF ALLOWANCE cannot answer, so a prompt sent to it is not a delivery.
 *
 * Overnight 2026-09-23/24 every `claude` session answered every prompt with
 * `You've hit your weekly limit · resets 8am (Europe/London)`. The ledger counted each send, eleven causes reached
 * six, and two rows were labelled `needs:chairman` for an outage. The fixtures below carry that sentence as the
 * transcript wrote it (both measured forms), and the tick is run as a process, because a seam is what a deleted call
 * goes around.
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROLS, named because "nothing was recorded / nothing was escalated" passes on an empty run:
 *   the same six deliveries to a HEALTHY session DO reach the cap ("SIX DELIVERIES ... HEALTHY"), the same
 *   escalation for a healthy session DOES go to gh ("... a healthy session's stuck cause"), and the tick DOES wake
 *   a healthy session and write its ledger line ("THE TICK ... a healthy").
