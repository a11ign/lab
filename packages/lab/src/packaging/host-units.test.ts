/**
 * #1858: A UNIT FILE IN THE REPOSITORY IS NOT A RUNNING TIMER.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-21. #1844 shipped the nightly fleet scheduler -- built so the fleet batch would stop
 * depending on a session remembering it -- and merged at 19:22Z. At 19:38Z the chairman asked why nothing
 * was happening: `systemctl --user is-enabled a11ign-fleet-gated-nightly.timer` said `not-found`. The unit
 * had never been copied out of `packages/agent-org/host/`. Installing the scheduler depended on a session
 * remembering, which is the defect the scheduler existed to remove.
 *
 * `a11ign-corpus-snapshot.timer` failed the same hour in the quieter way: installed, `enabled`, and
 * `inactive` on a host up for nine days -- `enable` without `--now`, and nothing ever said so.
