/**
 * #1858: A UNIT FILE IN THE REPOSITORY IS NOT A RUNNING TIMER.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-21. #1844 shipped the nightly fleet scheduler -- built so the fleet batch would stop
 * depending on a session remembering it -- and merged at 19:22Z. At 19:38Z the chairman asked why nothing
 * was happening: `systemctl --user is-enabled a11ign-fleet-gated-nightly.timer` said `not-found`. The unit
 * had never been copied out of `packages/agent-org/host/`. Installing the scheduler depended on a session
 * remembering, which is the defect the scheduler existed to remove.
 *
 * `a11ign-corpus-snapshot.timer` failed the same hour in the quieter way: installed, `enabled`, and
 * `inactive` on a host up for nine days -- `enable` without `--now`, and nothing ever said so.

// WHAT DISTINGUISHES IT, measured 22:23Z: two fresh throwaway units, identical calendar expression and
// `Persistent=true`, neither carrying a stamp file, differing ONLY in `Requires=`. The one with it ran its

// probes could not perform that experiment, because both of them carried an expired `OnBootSec=`, which
// fires on activation by itself and masks whatever else would have.

// shipped `.timer`, so `Requires=` in a timer silently appends "and runs once at every `host:install`" to

// --- #1998: the unit shipped here and the program it starts did not ----------------------------------
//
// MEASURED ON THE AGENT HOST 2026-09-22, at `874948280`. #1993 put the two board-dispatch units under
// `packages/agent-org/host/` so the daily edition stopped being invisible to this repository, and scoped
// itself to the units. Its `ExecStart` was `/home/agent/.local/bin/board-report-dispatch.sh`:
//
//     git log --oneline --all -- '**/board-report-dispatch*'   ->  (empty)
//     wc -l /home/agent/.local/bin/board-report-dispatch.sh    ->  31
//     grep -cE '\bgh (workflow run|run list)\b' <that file>    ->  2
//
// So the unit was reviewable and the thing it ran was not. Every property #1993 declared on the unit --
// which `gh` is on the PATH, which account it spends -- was a property of a `gh` call inside a file
// nobody here could read, and the next edit to it reached production with no diff, no review and no test.
//
// THE PROGRAM IS NOT COPIED ANYWHERE, and that is the answer to the CURRENT question rather than a gap
// in it. The units live in `~/.config/systemd/user` because systemd will not read them out of the tree;
// nothing makes that demand of a script, so the tree copy IS the program and a merged edit is live at
// the next firing. A second copy would re-create #1858's own defect one level down. What that leaves is
// the leftover at `~/.local/bin`, which `supersededHostScripts` reports until somebody removes it.
