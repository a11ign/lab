/**
 * #1858: A UNIT FILE IN THE REPOSITORY IS NOT A RUNNING TIMER.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-21. #1844 shipped the nightly fleet scheduler -- built so the fleet batch would stop
 * depending on a session remembering it -- and merged at 19:22Z. At 19:38Z the chairman asked why nothing
 * was happening: `systemctl --user is-enabled a11ign-fleet-gated-nightly.timer` said `not-found`. The unit
 * had never been copied out of `packages/agent-org/host/`. Installing the scheduler depended on a session
 * remembering, which is the defect the scheduler existed to remove.
 *
 * `a11ign-corpus-snapshot.timer` failed the same hour in the quieter way: installed, `enabled`, and
 * `inactive` on a host up for nine days -- `enable` without `--now`, and nothing ever said so.

// triggers ... The new test only checks the directive's text and therefore passes while the behavior is
// absent." Correct, and `systemd.timer(5)` says it outright: Persistent= "only has an effect on timers
// configured with OnCalendar=".
//
// THE CHECK READS THE DIRECTORY RATHER THAN THE ONE UNIT THE REVIEW NAMED, and that is how it earns its
// place: asked of every shipped timer it immediately found `a11ign-work-tick.timer` carrying the identical
// pairing, with a comment claiming a catch-up systemd was never going to perform. A test written only
// against the prune timer would have fixed the instance and left the class.

// --- #2011's review, round two: THE UNIT NAMED A CAUSE IT HAD NOT DISTINGUISHED -----------------------
//
// The first answer to this blocker said the prune that ran the instant `enable --now` was issued was
// `OnBootSec=` counting from a boot 9 days earlier. Forty minutes later the same unit -- now a calendar
// timer with no `OnBootSec` anywhere in it -- ran a prune the instant it was installed again, so the
// sentence the PR shipped was known-false in the file it shipped. `product-manager`, 2026-09-22: "a
// why-comment carrying a superseded mechanism is a defect in the artefact, not prose around it."
//
// WHAT DISTINGUISHES IT, measured 22:23Z: two fresh throwaway units, identical calendar expression and
// `Persistent=true`, neither carrying a stamp file, differing ONLY in `Requires=`. The one with it ran its
// service in the same second as `enable --now`; the one without never ran its service. The two earlier
// probes could not perform that experiment, because both of them carried an expired `OnBootSec=`, which
// fires on activation by itself and masks whatever else would have.
//
// AND IT IS A CLASS RATHER THAN THIS UNIT'S QUIRK. `hostUnitsInstall` runs `enable --now` over EVERY
// shipped `.timer`, so `Requires=` in a timer silently appends "and runs once at every `host:install`" to
// its service's contract -- true today of the corpus snapshot and the corpus release nightly as much as of
// the prune. This test is what makes adding it to a fifth timer a decision somebody makes rather than a
// consequence nobody reads.
