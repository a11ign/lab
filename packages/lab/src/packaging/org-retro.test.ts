/**
 * `packages/agent-org/src/org-retro.mjs` and its wiring in `work-gate.mjs`, #2938: THE DAILY RETROSPECTIVE. Once per UTC date the gate hands `ceo`
 * the last 24 hours' numbers, already computed, and `ceo` is ordered to find the CLASS behind each number that worsened.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER BELOW IS CHECKED BY HAND AGAINST A FIXTURE WINDOW, written out as a literal. A test built from the module's own constants moves
 * with them: `TICK_MINUTES` is 2 here as a literal so that dropping the idle-minute term, or changing the tick, goes red.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS THE 2026-10-01 WINDOW: zero merges, and #2824 offered and refused for 211 ticks (`UNDELIVERED engineers/ready-row-unclaimed/2824`,
 * counted from `a11ign-work-tick.service`'s journal in #2845). It must report a stall AND a non-zero idle-minute figure; every "not offered / not counted"
 * below is only worth anything because that window IS read as a stall through the same entry.
