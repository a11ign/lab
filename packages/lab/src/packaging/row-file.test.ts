/**
 * #735: the FILING-side twin of #707's claim-side gate -- `scripts/row-file.mjs` refuses to run
 * `gh issue create` when the body it would file is missing Region, Acceptance or Open-check, using the
 * SAME rule `row-claim` already enforces at claim time (`missingTemplateFields`, imported unchanged from
 * `row-claim/template-fields-rule.mjs`), asked one step earlier so the cost lands on whoever holds the
 * context rather than whoever claims the row later.
