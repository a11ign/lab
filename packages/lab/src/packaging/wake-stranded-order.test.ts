// no-token: gh -- drives the queue's ended-target resolution through injected seams and a PATH stub for `herdr`; the tick's default GitHub reader is never reached (no fixture order names a row), and PATH here holds nothing else
/**
 * #2459: an authored order queued to a session that has ENDED is resolved, not kept for ever.
 *
 * Its own file, and not a block in `wake.test.ts`, because the acceptance job has no `gh` token and that file
 * reaches GitHub. Delivery takes an injected `run` and the holder lookup an injected reader, so no herdr, no
 * host and no GitHub are needed -- and where the tick itself is the subject, `herdr` is a stub on a PATH that
 * holds nothing else, so a GitHub read cannot happen by accident.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROLS ARE NAMED HERE, because an emptiness assertion ("no order to a gone target survives a
 * tick") passes on an empty queue:
 *   MUST be resolved:  "an order to an ENDED session ..." (the drop) and "... is re-addressed ..."
 *   MUST NOT be:       "ABSENT IS NOT ENDED ..." (never started) and "A HERDR THAT DOES NOT ANSWER ..." (blind)
