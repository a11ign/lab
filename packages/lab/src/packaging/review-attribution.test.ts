/**
 * #2127 (owner rule changed by #2401: PR n belongs to `reviewer-<n>`, and the passages below that say odd/even
 * describe the rule as it stood when the defect was measured): THE REVIEWER PARITY RULE, MADE OBSERVABLE -- and the proof that this reader could not be
 * satisfied by the account that posts the review.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. `.claude/rules/agent-practices.md` gives odd pull requests to `reviewer` and
 * even ones to `reviewer-2`, and `work-gate.mjs` routes on exactly that. On 2026-09-23 `reviewer-2`
 * reviewed #2105 -- an ODD number -- twice, including the APPROVED, and nothing could see it: all four
 * reviews on that pull request carry `user.login == "a11ign-bot"`, because the two sessions share one
 * GitHub account. The session's name lived only in the review's body prose. A rule nothing can observe
 * cannot be enforced, reported, or counted; a human reading four review bodies an hour later is what
 * found this one.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS THE #2105 SHAPE ITSELF, and it is the test that must fail if this reader
 * stops working: an odd pull request with a `reviewer-2` attribution must read as a VIOLATION. The
 * `correct` cases below pass for a reader that answers "correct" to everything, so they are not the
 * control -- they are what stops the violation case being met by answering "violation" to everything.
 *
 * AND THE THIRD CASE IS THE WHOLE POINT: two reviews with the SAME `user.login` and different
 * reviewing sessions must come apart. A reader keyed on the login finds no disagreement anywhere in
 * this repository and looks like it works.
 *
 * FIELD NAMES ARE MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. The status fixtures below are the literal shapes GitHub
 * returned on 2026-09-23T12:40:51Z for a real status written by `a11ign-bot` (scopes `gist`,
 * `read:org`, `repo`; repository permission `push: true`) onto commit `74e4d1c5` of this row's own
 * branch: REST `commits/{sha}/statuses` spells `target_url`, GraphQL's `statusCheckRollup.contexts`
 * spells `targetUrl`, and a `StatusContext` node carries NO `name` -- which is why `newestPerName`
 * skips it and an attribution status cannot disturb the gate's read of the checks.
